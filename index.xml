      <description>My University made 2FA mandatory to access remote resources (such as SolidWorks, electrical labs, etc.) a while ago. Once 2FA was set up, however, it was applied universally; if I want to log into my university email, I need to use 2FA. If I want to check my grades, 2FA. If I want to see my schedule, 2FA. If I want to apply for scholarships, you guessed it, 2FA. There&amp;rsquo;s also no return policy on it either.</description>

      <description>I graduated from my Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science program last December. A month later, I&amp;rsquo;m in some bizarre purgatory where I spend my days applying for jobs, flicking through streaming services, and slowly rotting away from the inside. Seeing as I might actually spontaneously combust if I don&amp;rsquo;t do something to keep my brain active, here&amp;rsquo;s some thoughts on my university experience. I&amp;rsquo;m sure this will be followed up with belligerent posts on topics outside my expertise, as per internet convention.</description>

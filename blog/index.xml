      <description>According the Wikipedia:
 The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.
 This theory has two major shortcomings which I shall (very very seriously) outline, then propose a superior theory to.
 Hedonism does not adequately describe the variation of happiness A treadmill is a shit fucking analogy for the &amp;ldquo;spring&amp;rdquo; effect demonstrated above  Hedonism is Big Stupid Refering again to the premier source of absolute truth on the internet:</description>

      <title>Scholarships</title>

      <description>Tuition at my university costed about $$10,000$ per year; a steal when compared to lofty American universities like Stanford ($$80,000$), not great when compared to other schools in Canada (around $$6,000-$8,000$), and downright criminal when compared to some European schools (free?). This cost was partially offset by a decent scholarship setup. My entry scholarship was worth $$4,000$ for every year of my degree. Since it was a 5 year degree, this effectively covered $$20,000$ of tuition, or about two-fifths the cost of my degree.</description>

      <title>Two-Factor Authentication</title>

      <description>My University made 2FA mandatory to access remote resources (such as SolidWorks, electrical labs, etc.) a while ago. Once 2FA was set up, however, it was applied universally; if I want to log into my university email, I need to use 2FA. If I want to check my grades, 2FA. If I want to see my schedule, 2FA. If I want to apply for scholarships, you guessed it, 2FA. There&amp;rsquo;s also no return policy on it either.</description>

      <title>A Retrospection on University</title>

      <description>I graduated from my Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science program last December. A month later, I&amp;rsquo;m in some bizarre purgatory where I spend my days applying for jobs, flicking through streaming services, and slowly rotting away from the inside. Seeing as I might actually spontaneously combust if I don&amp;rsquo;t do something to keep my brain active, here&amp;rsquo;s some thoughts on my university experience. I&amp;rsquo;m sure this will be followed up with belligerent posts on topics outside my expertise, as per internet convention.</description>

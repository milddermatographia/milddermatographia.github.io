      <title>Scholarships</title>

      <description>Tuition at my university costed about $$10,000$ per year; a steal when compared to lofty American universities like Stanford ($$80,000$), not great when compared to other schools in Canada (around $$6,000-$8,000$), and downright criminal when compared to some European schools (free?). This cost was partially offset by a decent scholarship setup. My entry scholarship was worth $$4,000$ for every year of my degree. Since it was a 5 year degree, this effectively covered $$20,000$ of tuition, or about two-fifths the cost of my degree.</description>

      <description>My University made 2FA mandatory to access remote resources (such as SolidWorks, electrical labs, etc.) a while ago. Once 2FA was set up, however, it was applied universally; if I want to log into my university email, I need to use 2FA. If I want to check my grades, 2FA. If I want to see my schedule, 2FA. If I want to apply for scholarships, you guessed it, 2FA. There&amp;rsquo;s also no return policy on it either.</description>

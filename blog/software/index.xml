      <description>Have you ever opened an old bookmark only to find it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist? Or read an article and tried to follow a link, only to get a 404 error? You&amp;rsquo;ve encountered link rot, the phenomenon where an older link is no longer valid; that web-page has effectively disappeared.
It&amp;rsquo;s an unfortunate side-effect of how the internet functions. If someone restructures their website, an article which was previously at domain.com/article might now be at domain.</description>

      <title>Wanting to love Arch and SwayWM</title>

      <description>I originally wrote a long post about transitioning back from Arch to Ubuntu and how slow everything feels in comparison. I then reinstalled Arch and SwayWM, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Firefox to use Wayland, no matter where I placed MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 or export MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1. XWayland programs were a blurry mess. I had managed to get everything working the first time around (sort of), but this time, no amount of DDG or Googling could work it out.</description>

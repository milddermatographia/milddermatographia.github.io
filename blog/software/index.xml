      <description>I originally wrote a long post about transitioning back from Arch to Ubuntu and how slow everything feels in comparison. I then reinstalled Arch and SwayWM, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Firefox to use Wayland, no matter where I placed MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 or export MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1. XWayland programs were a blurry mess. I had managed to get everything working the first time around (sort of), but this time, no amount of DDG or Googling could work it out.</description>

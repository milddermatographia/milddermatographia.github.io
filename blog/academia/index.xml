      <title>Scholarships</title>

      <description>Tuition at my university costed about $$10,000$ per year; a steal when compared to lofty American universities like Stanford ($$80,000$), not great when compared to other schools in Canada (around $$6,000-$8,000$), and downright criminal when compared to some European schools (free?). This cost was partially offset by a decent scholarship setup. My entry scholarship was worth $$4,000$ for every year of my degree. Since it was a 5 year degree, this effectively covered $$20,000$ of tuition, or about two-fifths the cost of my degree.</description>

      <description>I graduated from my Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science program last December. A month later, I&amp;rsquo;m in some bizarre purgatory where I spend my days applying for jobs, flicking through streaming services, and slowly rotting away from the inside. Seeing as I might actually spontaneously combust if I don&amp;rsquo;t do something to keep my brain active, here&amp;rsquo;s some thoughts on my university experience. I&amp;rsquo;m sure this will be followed up with belligerent posts on topics outside my expertise, as per internet convention.</description>
